# This script is used to go around a feature (bug?) of docker.
# When the /etc/ega/ssl.key is injected,
# it is owned by the host user that injected it.
# On Travis, it's the travis (2000) user.
# It needs to be 600 or less, meaning no group nor world access.
#
# In other words, the lega user cannot read that file.
#
# So we use the following trick.
# We make:
#     * /etc/ega/ssl.key world-readable.
#     * /etc/ega owned by the lega group (so we can write a file in it)
# and then, we copy /etc/ega/ssl.key to /etc/ega/ssl.key.lega
# But this time, owned by lega, and with 400 permissions
#
# This should not be necessary for the deployment
# as they are capable of injecting a file with given owner and permissions.
#

cp /etc/ega/ssl.key /etc/ega/ssl.key.lega
chmod 400 /etc/ega/ssl.key.lega
